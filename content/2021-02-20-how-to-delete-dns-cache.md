I thought to remind myself about cleaning the DNS cache history every once in a while. After a bit of research I discovered what to type in the command line (this is for windows), open up your terminal in admin mode and type `ipconfig /flashdns`. That's it DNS cache is clean. To see what you have stored before deleting it you can type `ipconfig /displaydns`. And this operation is reccommended to do every once in a while, I'm I safe now?? maybe a little bit more?? I don't know yet ðŸš€
