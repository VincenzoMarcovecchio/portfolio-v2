Which one of the following is the BEST description of a test condition?


- a) An attribute of a component or system specified or implied by requirements 
documentation.

- b) An aspect of the test basis that is relevant to achieve specific test objectives.

- c) The capability of the software product to provide functions which meet stated and 
implied needs when the software is used under specified conditions.

- d) The percentage of all single condition outcomes that independently affect a decision 
outcome that have been exercised by a test case suite.
Select one option.




<b>Justification</b>



a) Not correct – Definition of feature according to Glossary.

b) Correct – From Glossary.

c) Not correct – Definition of functionality according to Glossary.

d) Not correct – Definition of modified condition decision coverage according to Glossary.

Which of the following statements is a valid objective for testing?


- a) To determine whether enough component tests were executed within system testing.

- b) To find as many failures as possible so that defects can be identified and corrected.

- c) To prove that all possible defects are identified.

- d) To prove that any remaining defects will not cause any failures.


Select one option.

FL-1.1.1 (K1) Identify typical objectives of testing



<b>Justification</b>



a) Not correct – Component testing is not part of System testing.

b) Correct – Syllabus 1.1.1

c) Not correct – Principle #1 states that exhaustive testing is impossible, so one can 
never prove that all defects were identified.

d) Not correct – To make an assessment whether a defect will cause a failure or not, one 
has to detect the defect first. Saying that no remaining defect will cause a failure, implicitly means that all defects were found. This contradicts Principle #1.

Which of the following statements correctly describes the difference between testing and 
debugging?


- a) Testing identifies the source of defects; debugging analyzes the defects and proposes 
prevention activities.

- b) Testing shows failures caused by defects; debugging finds, analyzes, and removes the 
causes of failures in the software.

- c) Testing removes faults; debugging identifies the causes of failures.

- d) Testing prevents the causes of failures; debugging removes the failures.


Select one option.
FL-1.1.2 (K2) Differentiate testing from debugging




<b>Justification</b>



a) Not correct. Testing does not identify the source of defects.

b) Correct. Syllabus 1.1.2: Executing tests can show failures that are caused by defects 
in the 8 software. Debugging is the development activity that finds, analyzes, and fixes 
such defects.

c) Not correct. Testing does not remove faults.

d) Not correct. Testing does not directly prevent the causes of failures. Debugging does 
not removes the failures, only the causes of failures

Which one of the statements below describes a failure discovered during testing or in 
production?


- a) The product crashed when the user selected an option in a dialog box.

- b) The wrong version of one source code file was included in the build.

- c) The computation algorithm used the wrong input variables.

- d) The developer misinterpreted the requirement for the algorithm.


Select one option.
FL-1.2.3 (K2) Distinguish between error, defect and failure




<b>Justification</b>



a) Correct – A failure is an external manifestation of a defect. A crash is clearly 
noticeable by the user.

b) Not correct – This is a defect, not a failure, since there is something wrong in the code. 
It may not result in a failure, for example if the changes in the source code file are only 
in comments.

c) Not correct – This is a defect, not a failure, as there is a flaw in the code implementing 
the algorithm. If this computation is not used in a test or in production, a failure will not 
occur.

d) Not correct – This is an error, not a failure. The misinterpretation of the requirement 
may or may not lead to a defect in the impementation of the algorithm, which in turn 
may or may not lead to a failure.
